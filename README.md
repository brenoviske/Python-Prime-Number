Hi there Developers.
To put up to the test my skills both in Python and JavaScript, in this new project of mine, I made a software programm able to determine if a given positive integer, gretaer than one , is prime or not.

ðŸ’» Technologies used
ðŸªŸ Frontend:
HTML5 - For structuring and creating a solid foundation for the software.
CSS - Used for styling and arranging elements within the web content, using the home screen of the Artificial Intelligence model, GPT4, as the primary source of inspiration.
Java Script - Used to create 2D animations within the page, using the Observer API, which, together with CSS, allows me to create dynamic transition effects between elements.

ðŸ’¾ Backend:
Python/Flask Framework - Using Python's web development framework, Flask, I was able to create an algorithm for the purpose of the proposed idea, taking advantage of several tools and Python's flexible and didactic language.

Feel free to give me your feeedback.
